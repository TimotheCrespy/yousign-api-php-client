Yousign REST API Client.

PRs are of course highly appreciated, as well as improvement suggestions!

## Structure

```
src/
tests/
examples/
```

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require timothecrespy/yousign-api-php-client
```

## Usage

### Note

For testing, and obviously for production, an internet connexion is required.

### Framework agnostic

``` php
use TimotheCrespy\YousignClient;

// It is recommended to store these values in a .env or equivalent file
const YOUSIGN_PRODUCTION_API_URL = 'https://api.yousign.com';
const YOUR_PRODUCTION_API_KEY = '[YOUR_PRODUCTION_API_KEY]';

$yousignClient = new YousignClient([
    'api_url' => self::YOUSIGN_PRODUCTION_API_URL,
    'api_key' => self::YOUR_PRODUCTION_API_KEY
]);
```

As the Yousign production API is not free, you might want to test it, with the staging environment:

``` php
use TimotheCrespy\YousignClient;

// It is recommended to store these values in a .env or equivalent file
const YOUSIGN_STAGING_API_URL = 'https://staging-api.yousign.com';
const YOUR_STAGING_API_KEY = '[YOUR_STAGING_API_KEY]';

$yousignClient = new YousignClient([
    'api_url' => self::YOUSIGN_STAGING_API_URL,
    'api_key' => self::YOUR_STAGING_API_KEY
]);
```

### Laravel

Requirement : version `6.*` minimum

```php
// If you are using Laravel (https://github.com/laravel/laravel), you could specify the default Laravel logger:
$loggerInstance = Illuminate\Support\Facades\Log::getLogger();
$yousignClient->setLogger($loggerInstance);

$yousignClient->getUsers();
```

## Change log

Please see [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for more information on what has changed recently.

## Testing

All this package is based on the notion that the Yousign's `staging` environment is strictly similar to the `production` environment. Hence the tests based on this `staging` environment. Therefore, the API is not stubbed, as this `staging` environment is free and without any restriction.

Testing for a PR is however done this way:
``` bash
$ composer test
```
or
``` bash
$ ./vendor/bin/phpcs
$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```
